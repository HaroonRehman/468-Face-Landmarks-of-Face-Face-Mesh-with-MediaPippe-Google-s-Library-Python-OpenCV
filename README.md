# 468-Face-Landmarks-of-Face-with-MediaPippe-Google-s-Library-Python-OpenCV


## Overview
MediaPipe Face Mesh is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D facial surface, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor. Utilizing lightweight model architectures together with GPU acceleration throughout the pipeline, the solution delivers real-time performance critical for live experiences.

The Program will detect 468 Face Landmarks with Google's Framework called Medaipipe for media.It is  a model provided by google that runs in real-time on CPU and mobile devices.

###### These points can be used in other projects like Face Recognition etc.

##### Note: 
This framework is very useful it be used for object detection, face mash, face detectoin, bodi position detection etc.
This is a robust framework which is avilable for C++ Javascript IOS/Android etc.

###### I would like notedown an alternatvie to this framework -----> Yolo7 ( current version )
